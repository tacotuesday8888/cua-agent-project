# Mac Autopilot Validation Matrix

This matrix separates checks that can run anywhere from checks that require
local macOS privacy grants. Record failures with the app, command, exact task,
and final agent summary.

## Automated Baseline

Run before every implementation batch:

```sh
swift test --package-path AutopilotKit
xcodebuild -project MacAutopilot.xcodeproj -scheme MacAutopilot -destination 'platform=macOS' -derivedDataPath .build/xcode build
```

Expected result: package tests pass and the app target builds.

## Fixture Driver Validation

Requires Accessibility permission for the fixture app and the smoke CLI process.

Terminal 1:

```sh
swift run --package-path AutopilotKit AutopilotFixtureApp
```

Terminal 2:

```sh
swift run --package-path AutopilotKit AutopilotSmokeCLI --app AutopilotFixtureApp
swift run --package-path AutopilotKit AutopilotSmokeCLI --app AutopilotFixtureApp --agent-loop
swift run --package-path AutopilotKit AutopilotSmokeCLI --app AutopilotFixtureApp --include-screenshot
```

Expected result: the nine-tool smoke surface passes. The screenshot run also
requires Screen Recording permission and should report PNG bytes.

## Live Provider Validation

Requires a saved Keychain key from the app or a process-local environment key.
Do not commit keys or write them into docs.

```sh
ZAI_API_KEY=... swift run --package-path AutopilotKit AutopilotSmokeCLI --app AutopilotFixtureApp --live-provider zai
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... swift run --package-path AutopilotKit AutopilotSmokeCLI --app AutopilotFixtureApp --live-provider anthropic
```

Expected result: the fixture input ends with `live smoke value`, the agent calls
`done`, and the smoke CLI reports success. Z.AI is configured as text-only, so
screenshot requests must be omitted or explicitly warned about.

## Safe Real-App Matrix

Use non-destructive tasks only. Do not test send, delete, purchase, sign-out, or
external submission flows until destructive approval behavior is under review.

| App | Command | Safe task | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TextEdit | `--dump-tree` | Type a short note into an untitled document | Text appears and no destructive approval fires |
| Notes | `--dump-tree` | Read visible note titles or type into a test note | Agent identifies current controls from AX tree |
| Safari or Chrome | `--dump-tree` | Read page title or type into a local/search field | Agent handles web accessibility labels or asks user |
| Finder | `--dump-tree` | Read visible file names in a test folder | No file mutation occurs |
| Calendar or Mail | `--dump-tree` | Read visible labels only | Agent avoids send/delete workflows |

For each app, capture:

- macOS version and app version
- target window state: focused, minimized, hidden, multi-window
- tree element count
- task text
- tools performed
- failure summary and recovery text

## Permission Checks

Apple documents Accessibility trust through
`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` and Screen Recording through
`CGPreflightScreenCaptureAccess` / `CGRequestScreenCaptureAccess`. Verify:

- Missing Accessibility blocks runs before the first LLM call.
- Missing Screen Recording is a warning unless screenshots are requested.
- Re-checking permissions after returning from System Settings updates the UI.

## Release Gate

A release candidate must pass:

- automated baseline
- fixture driver validation
- one live smoke for each enabled provider
- at least three safe real-app tasks
- manual approval test for one write action and one destructive action
